The selresgram grammar takes as starting point the allegro grammar (../allegro/grammar) and extends it to include selectional restriction (semtype attribute).

All extension/bug fixes will from now on be carried out on selresgram

The grammar can be used without selectional restriction checks by
using the lexicon without semtype equations .
