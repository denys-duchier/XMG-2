Getting started: 

Install contributions:

XMG-NG builds metagrammar compiler from compiler bricks. These bricks
belong to contributions. To make a set of bricks available, you need
to install a contribution. This is done with the command "xmg install
path_to_contribution". For example, to work with the TAG compiler, you
need to install two contribution: contributions/core and
contributions/treemg

Building a compiler:

Before compiling a metagrammar, you need to build a compiler. Some of
them are available as contributions. To do so, you should use the
command "xmg build" inside the compiler brick. For example, to
generate the TAG compiler:

 cd contributions/synsemCompiler/compilers/synsem; xmg build

To use the compiler you just built, you need to install the
synsemCompiler contribution.

Compile a metagrammar:

The command "xmg compile" allows to use a compiler on a metagrammar. For example, using the TAG compiler on an example file can be done with:

xmg compile synsem Metagrammars/synsem/DummyExample.mg (with the
--force option if you already compiled the file once)
