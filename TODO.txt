* make the creation of plugins less tedious: after writing the preparer and solver for the plugin, one has to edit the preparer of the general principle (e.g. tree) and the principles file in brick decls. 

* YAP is broken (attributed variables cause errors after commit a34b45b), how can we simplify the installation?

* repair brick morphtf (or the metagrammars)

* provide minimal examples in Metagrammars for every compiler (type definitions, etc)

* all these compiler.yap files should have better names, like executor.yap or evaluator.yap (except the one in brick mg, which is the compiler)

* Bug in the LALR Parser generator:
  Minimal example:
    S: (int)? 'b' 'c'
     | 'b';

    b and 4bc can be parsed but not bc
    bc can be parsed if the second clause is removed
    Happens only if the optional NT is the first symbol of the RHS
